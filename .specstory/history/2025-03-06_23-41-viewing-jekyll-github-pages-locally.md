---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up and view your Jekyll GitHub Pages website locally. First, let me check your project structure to ensure we have the necessary files.

I can see this is a Jekyll website with all the necessary files. To view it locally, you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system (since you're on macOS, Ruby should already be installed)
2. Install the required gems (Jekyll and its dependencies)
3. Run the Jekyll server

Let me check your Gemfile to see what dependencies we need:

---

Read file: Gemfile

---

Perfect! Here are the steps to view your website locally:

1. First, install the required gems by running these commands in your terminal:
```bash
bundle install
```

2. Once the installation is complete, start the Jekyll server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

3. After the server starts, you can view your website by opening a web browser and navigating to:
```
http://localhost:4000
```

The server will automatically watch for changes in your files and rebuild the site when you make updates. You'll see the changes reflected in your browser after refreshing the page.

Some common troubleshooting tips:
- If you get any permission errors during `bundle install`, you might need to use `sudo bundle install`
- If port 4000 is already in use, you can specify a different port using `bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001`
- If you make changes to `_config.yml`, you'll need to restart the server for those changes to take effect

Would you like me to help you with anything specific about running the site locally?

where is schedule page ?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see `schedule.md` in your workspace. Let me check its contents:

---

Read file: schedule.md

---

The schedule page is available in your website and contains a comprehensive course schedule with links to lecture materials. When you run the Jekyll site locally (using the commands I provided earlier), you'll be able to access the schedule page in two ways:

1. Through the navigation menu (it's set with `nav_order: 1` so it should appear prominently)
2. Directly via URL: `http://localhost:4000/schedule`

The page includes:
- A link to the overall schedule in Google Sheets
- A detailed table of all lectures with dates, topics, and links to lecture materials
- Setup & installation information
- Policy information about usage of class materials

The page appears to be for a course focused on advanced computing topics, covering containers, LLMs, deployment, and other technical subjects. Is there something specific about the schedule you'd like to know more about?

I want to add 2 PDF files for the lecture date 3/6

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the PDF files for the March 6th lecture (Lecture 10 - LLM fine tuning and LORA - II). First, let's check if there's an assets/lectures directory structure:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory assets • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `projects` |
| 📁 `lectures` |
| 📁 `images` |
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |

</details>

---

Great! I see there's an `assets/lectures` directory. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a folder for lecture 10 (if it doesn't exist already) in the `assets/lectures` directory. The path should be `assets/lectures/lecture10/`

2. Place your two PDF files in that directory. Based on the naming convention used in other lectures, you might want to name them something like:
   - `L10-FineTuning-Part1.pdf`
   - `L10-FineTuning-Part2.pdf`

3. Then, you'll need to update the schedule.md file to link to these PDFs. Here's how the updated entry should look in your schedule.md:

```markdown:schedule.md
// ... existing entries ...
| Lecture 9      | 3/4   | LLM fine tuning and LORA - I | [View](../assets/lectures/lecture9/L09-FineTuning.pdf) |
| Lecture 10     | 3/6   | LLM fine tuning and LORA - II | [Part 1](../assets/lectures/lecture10/L10-FineTuning-Part1.pdf), [Part 2](../assets/lectures/lecture10/L10-FineTuning-Part2.pdf) |
| Lecture 11     | 3/11  | Model Optimization: Distillation, Compression | [View](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUWNjv1N5SYuSAKUy7kQ4XBMDgLU56Mj/view?usp=sharing) |
// ... remaining entries ...
```

Steps to implement this:
1. Create the directory: `mkdir -p assets/lectures/lecture10`
2. Copy your PDF files into that directory with the appropriate names
3. Update the `schedule.md` file with the new links
4. After making these changes, if you're running Jekyll locally (`bundle exec jekyll serve`), refresh your browser to see the updates

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps? Also, what are the actual names of your PDF files so we can use those or rename them appropriately?
